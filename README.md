### My attempt of making a Netflix Clone 
### 3rd March
Made one section of the Clone, used calc function to make box height come off perfectly
### 4th March
Made the 3rd section by mistake, was able to use positioning correctly to get the box on the image right, fixed responsiveness,
fixed the border radius of the email box
Nice Stuff
### 5th Match
1. Minor text responsiveness alignment,renaming, adding and deleting obsolete code. <br>
2. Add favicon and changed title of site <br>
3. Made all other sections excluding the footer <br>
4. Special points: Z index only works on elements having position other than static, was able to place video in the boxes in the website <br>
5. Add muted attribute to video to make it autoplay and seem less intrusive to browser
### 8th March
1. Made the footer section with grid and made it responsive.<br>
2. Minor fixes for responsiveness.<br>
3. Finally done!!!!!!!
